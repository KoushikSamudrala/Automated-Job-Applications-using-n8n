# Automated-Job-Applications-using-n8n
An independent project for automating the tedious process of Job applications with interactive user interface of n8n.

 The workflow includes:
   - A schedule trigger that runs daily at 9 AM.
   - An HTTP request to LinkedIn to fetch job postings.
   - HTML extraction to parse job details (title, company, location, applyUrl, datePosted).
   - Splitting the array of jobs into individual items.
   - For each job, making an HTTP request to the job URL to get the full description.
   - Extracting the job description from the HTML.
   - Using Google Gemini to generate a cover letter based on the job description and the candidate's resume.
   - Setting the generated cover letter in the workflow data.
   - Splitting out the cover letter for individual processing.
   - Appending or updating rows in a Google Sheet (with two separate Google Sheet nodes).
